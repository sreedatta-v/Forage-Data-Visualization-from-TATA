# Forage-Data-Visualization-from-TATA

## Background information of Task 
An online retail store has hired you as a <b>consultant</b> to review their data and provide insights that would be valuable to the CEO and CMO of the business. The business has been performing well and the management wants to analyse what the major contributing factors are to the revenue so they can strategically plan for next year.

The leadership is interested in viewing the metrics from both an <b>operations and marketing perspective</b>. Management also intends to expand the business and is interested in seeking guidance into areas that are performing well so they can keep a clear focus on what’s working. They would also like to view different metrics based on the demographic information that is available in the data.

A meeting with the CEO and CMO has been scheduled for next month and you need to draft the relevant analytics and insights that would help evaluate the current business performance and suggest metrics that would enable them to make the decision on expansion.

Remember, thinking from the perspective of business leaders allows you to analyse the data more effectively and present better insights.

To prepare for your meeting, you need to draft questions that you think will be important and relevant to the CEO and CMO. This preparation will be your guide as you develop your presentation.

For this task, you are only required to draft the questions. Make sure to think both quantitatively and qualitatively.

You’ve been provided a dataset in the resources below to use as the basis for your exploration. Review this data, taking note of what information has been provided, what insights you can garner, and what is relevant to both the CEO and CMO respectively.

Create a set of four questions that you anticipate each business leader will ask and want to know the answers to. Make sure you differentiate your questions, as both the CEO and CMO view business decisions through different lenses.

### Questions from the perspective of the CEO:  
1. Which region is generating more revenue? Lower region and higher region?
2. Which monthly trend has generated more revenue?
3. Is there any seasonal change in purchasing products?
4. Who are the top customers and how do they contribute to revenue?

### Questions from the perspective of the CMO:  
1. What is the percentage of customers who are repeating their orders?
2. For repeated customers, how long is it going to place the next order?
3. How much revenue is being generated from customers who have ordered more than one product?
4. For repeated customers, how much do they contribute to revenue?

## Task 2 
1. Identify the visual that would explain the data and insights in the simplest possible manner.

### Background information of task 
You have been asked by the CEO and CMO to provide visuals on the metrics that they wish to analyze for the online retail store. You will gather the requirements and provide them with the type of visual that would be best suited to the scenario.  

<b>The senior management wants to understand how their business is performing and what areas are the key strengths of the company.</b> 

They are also focused on identifying opportunities that would lead to growth and generate more revenue in the future.  

You will be provided multiple visualization requests by the CEO and you would need to provide the visual which would explain the data and insights in the simplest possible manner. The visual should adequately convey the information that you are trying to present. This exercise is critical to the senior management as any incorrect representation can lead to a wrong message being conveyed, or a wrong decision taken by the management. Therefore, you would need to make sure that the correct visuals are used to represent each set of data.

## About Task
In this task, you will be required to read the questions carefully and understand that business requirement. Once you have an idea of what is required from the perspective of the CEO and CMO, you will need to come up with the perfect visual which will illustrate what the senior managers are looking for in each scenario. Remember, data can be presented in multiple types of charts, but you are required to select the visual that would best display the information which is being presented.

You will be provided resources on how to select visuals based on the different scenarios, these are available in the resources below. These resources will help you get an idea on which visual to select for the given business scenario and will also guide you on how to choose the right chart or graph for your data. Each question will contain a unique scenario and you will be expected to answer the questions based on that scenario.
